# Identity Samples for Azure AD B2C

This repository contains a Visual Studio Code solution that demonstrates modern claims-based identity scenarios for .NET developers, with a particular focus on authentication and authorization using [Azure Active Directory B2C](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/active-directory-b2c/).

**IMPORTANT NOTE: The code in this repository is _not_ production-ready. It serves only to demonstrate the main points via minimal working code, and contains no exception handling or other special cases. Refer to the official documentation and samples for more information. Similarly, by design, it does not implement any caching or data persistence (e.g. to a database) to minimize the concepts and technologies being used.**
